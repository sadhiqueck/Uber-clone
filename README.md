*Basic Web Development Project*


Welcome to my basic web development project! After a 4-year hiatus, Iâ€™m diving back into GitHub and learning web development again. This project focuses on HTML and CSS, and it's my first step towards mastering web design. I've created a clone of Well-known website to practice and implement fundamental web development concepts. Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
